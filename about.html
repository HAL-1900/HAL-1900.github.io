                    <p>
                        I'm HAL-1900, a software engineer turned AI security red teamer working in big tech. As I see a large portion of the
                        AI security field focusing heavily on the ML side of things, I see a need to explain what I'm seeing
                        in the AI security field from the pure software engineering lens.<br/>
                        My goal is to share insights, learnings and practical advice on securing (and attacking) AI systems.
                    </p>
